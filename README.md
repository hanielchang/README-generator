# README GENERATOR

## Description

This code uses the inquirer package to prompt a user via the command line.
It will ask for the title of a project, a description, table of contents, installation guide, usage, license, contributions, tests instructions, and 
questions. In the questions section, one can find a link to the associated
github profile, as well as an email entered by the user for contact. 

## Video Demonstration

Unfortunately, I could not directly link the video file because it uses an 
unsupported text encoding file. Instead I will provide here the link to my 
Screencastify video demonstration. Enjoy!
