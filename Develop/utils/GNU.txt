People often ask us what license we recommend they use for their project. We've written about this publicly before, but the information has been scattered around between different essays, FAQ entries, and license commentaries. This article collects all that information into a single source, to make it easier for people to follow and refer back to.

These recommendations are for works designed to do practical jobs. Those include software, documentation, and some other things. Works of art, and works that state a point of view, are different issues; the GNU Project has no general stand about how they should be released, except that they should all be usable without nonfree software (in particular, without DRM). However, you might want to follow these recommendations for art works that go with a particular program.

The recommendations apply to licensing a work that you createâ€”whether that's a modification of an existing work, or a new original work. They do not address the issue of combining existing material under different licenses. If you're looking for help with that, please check our GPL FAQ.

After you see what we recommend here, if you'd like advice, you can write to <licensing@gnu.org>. Note that it will probably take a few weeks for the licensing team to get back to you; if you get no response in a month, please write again.
